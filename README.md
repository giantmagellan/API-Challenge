# API-Challenge

3 OBSERVABLE TRENDS:

1. Not all cities found contained any data at all, which speaks to how remote and/or primitive some of the cities found may be. However, those cities that did contain weather data all had values for every parameter. 

2. The data is being uploaded frequently and therefore it is important to understand that through each run of the code the outputs will differ -- if using the 'Current Weather Data' api. 

3. Data provided is presented in a more universal-friendly format such as Kelvin (temperature), Unix (time), Pascal (pressure), etc. The user must be mindful of proper conversions for who the visualizations may be presented.
